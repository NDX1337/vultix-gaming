Special thanks:
Sometimes new Anti-Bounce versions are released thanks to the remarks of other people. We want to thank the following people:

HaloXene (v2.4.0): 
Pointing out that less bounces were detected from v2.3.0 on leading to the changes in how ground detection system handles vehicle rotations.

V1sh4l (v2.3.0):
For making me re-check the Anti-Bounce ground detection and noticing how inaccurate it was.

Ramsy (v2.3.0):
For performing a lot of tests with the Anti-Bounce and how it reacted on certain parts on maps. This leaded to the update of the ground detection system.
